# Neural Networks - Deep Learning Assignments
This repository contains my assignments from the Neural Networks - Deep Learning university course (NDM-07-05). The course covered topics such as neural networks, support vector machines, and radial basis function neural networks.

## Assignment 1: Neural Networks
### Theme
- The MNIST digit classification using MLP.

#### Experiments related to the learning part, as it was described and analyzed in the lectures of the course:
- Comparison with KNN, Nearest Class Centroid.
- Weight initialization.
- Standardization-Normalization.
- One Hot Encoding.
- Batch, Mini-Batch, Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Data Shuffling.
- Cross Validation for hyper-parameter tuning.
- Committees of Neural Networks.

## Assignment 2: Support Vector Machines
### Theme
- Recognition of odd and even numbers in the decimal digits (0,1,â€¦,9) of MNIST.

#### Experiments related to the learning part, as it was described and analyzed in the lectures of the course:
- Comparison with KNN, Nearest Class Centroid.
- Standardization-Normalization.
- Regularization Parameter(C) & Kernels(eg Polynomial).
- Consecutive Cross Validations for hyper-parameter tuning.
- Training with the best set of parameters.
- Primal Vs Dual Space.

## Assignment 3: Radial Basis Function Neural Networks
### Theme
- The MNIST digit classification using RBF NNs.

#### Experiments related to the learning part, as it was described and analyzed in the lectures of the course:
- Comparison with KNN, Nearest Class Centroid and MLPs.
- Different Standard Deviations for the Gaussian function.
- Different Centroid Initializations for the Gaussian function.
- Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

##### Each Jupyter Notebook in the repository corresponds to a separate assignment and includes both the source code and the corresponding report.
